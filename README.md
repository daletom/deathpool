# deathpool

Creating a Game of Thrones Deathpool using Vue.js.  The idea is that before the final season starts, friends can go here and submit their responses in the form to decide if they think a character will live or die.  Once they click submit, the responses will be sent to a backend to store the data (needs to be made) and once the season begins the site will display a score for each user that submitted a response.
